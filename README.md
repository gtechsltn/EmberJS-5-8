As of today, Sunday, April 20, 2025, the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Ember.js is 5.8. It was promoted to LTS on November 20, 2024.

## Recommended Node.js Versions:
As of April 2025, the currently supported Active LTS versions of Node.js are v18, v20, and v22.

It is highly recommended to use the most recent Active LTS version of Node.js for the best compatibility and to avoid potential issues.

## Specific Compatibility with Ember CLI:

Looking at the compatibility matrix for ember-cli, it indicates the following support as of the latest information:

* Node.js v18: Supported by ember-cli versions 4.6.0 and later.
* Node.js v20: Supported by ember-cli versions 5.4.0 and later.
* Node.js v22: Supported by ember-cli versions 6.2.0 and later.

Since Ember.js 5.8 was released around April 2024, it is expected to work well with the ember-cli versions that support the active Node.js LTS releases at that time and the subsequent ones.

Therefore, for Ember.js 5.8, you should aim to use either Node.js v18, v20, or v22. Using the latest LTS version (currently v22) is generally advisable for new projects as it will have the longest support window.
